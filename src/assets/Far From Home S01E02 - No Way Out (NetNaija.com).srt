[Ishaya in English]
You can't go to the police.

4
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:17,937
Oga Rambo bribes them.

5
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:21,187
If they tell him, he'll do something
to Rahila. Please don't go.

00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:25,396
[in Yoruba] You are just like your father.

8
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:31,646
[in English] See how you're destroying
your sister's life to follow your dream.

[sniffles]

10
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,187
Just like your father killed his son,

Dauda, just for the love of art.

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:43,354

Uncle, please, I'm begging you with God.

Ijoba.

23
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:54,854
[in Yoruba] We should have killed the boy
and fed him to Angel.

24
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:58,229

[in Pidgin] Sir, hold on.
This money is not complete.

I liked the way
you played with me all night.

[in Pidgin] What happened?

45
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,146
[Joe] Mr. Moscow
says she refuses to dance,

46
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,521
and since Government isn't around,
I brought her to you.

47
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:41,896
[Oga Rambo in Yoruba] You want me
to teach her how to dance?

48

49
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:48,521
[in Yoruba] She's that thief's sister!

00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,021
We gave him a job,
but instead he stole from us.

51
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:53,312
Take her for dance training.

52
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:55,021
[in English] Uh…

53
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:57,604
Rambo, she's not Rush's standard.

54

[in Yoruba] Uh-huh?
She can't dance for Rush.

55
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,562
[Oga Rambo] She looks like a fish.

56

Rahila is in a stripper's uniform at Rush?

00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,521
Did your boyfriend not kidnap her?

75
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:51,271
Didn't you steal from him?

76
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,521
[in English] What's the plan?
You have to get her out.

77
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:58,104

they were smoking some type of weed
that I've never smelled before.

Mr. Government, these children,
they have money.

Please give me some molly,
let me sell it to them.

they spend millions to party,

117
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:42,021
and if he goes to the school,
they can trust him and buy--

Don't do that again.

Sir?

130
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:35,521
This is more than what I owe you, sir.

131
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:38,854
Since you can't pay me what you owe me,
I own your life.

132

Give him his sister.

[Michael in Pidgin] That makes no sense.

146
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:27,604
Why did you tell Government
you could sell this at Wilmer?

147
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:28,896
What should I have said?

148
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,729
I don't know, but not this.

149
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:34,271
[smacks lips] Do you even have the balls
to sell drugs for Government?

150
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:38,187
I don't have a choice.

It will last longer.

160
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:20,937
I'm here to see Ms. Irurhe.

161
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:24,146
I just wanted to ask her
about the London art competition thing.

162
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:25,354
How about you?

163
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:28,521
-Planning Founder's Day ball.
-Which one is that one?

drink champagne,

00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,687
in the name of our founding father.

166
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,146
I can introduce you to a few millionaires

167

[Ms. Irurhe] Okay, Ishaya.
Um, let's get started after lunch.

175
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,312
[upbeat music playing]

176
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:23,312
[in Pidgin] Why didn't you get this thing?

177
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,729
[in English] It's a shrimp wrap.
I'm allergic to seafood.

178
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,104
[Ishaya] Shrimp wrap.

179
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:34,479
[in Pidgin] Food's good, right?

180
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:36,146
It's good. It's actually good.

181
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:39,562
-[in English] Ishaya, are you on Blink?
-[Ishaya] Yeah.

182
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:41,812
[phone chimes]

183
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:46,521
Party this weekend. You ready?

184
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:49,562
-Those guys, are they on Blink too?
-[Frank] Yeah.

185
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:51,104
Coke go choke.

186
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,021
Take a look.

187
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:59,021
[in Pidgin] Wow, who's this Reggie guy?

188
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:03,021
[in English] Captain of the football team,
son of Senator Flag-Kukrubo.

189
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:05,687
-And a tall glass of hot chocolate.
-[Ishaya] Okay.

190
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,979
I heard he's having a party
at his house this weekend.

191
00:13:08,562 --> 00:13:11,062
-But you have to be invited.
-How do I get invited?

192
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:13,104
Be cool
or be a member of the football team.

193
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:14,312
Tryouts are tomorrow.

194
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:15,729
Tryouts?

195
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,562
Guy, download the school app.

196
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,896
[intriguing music playing]

197
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,479
[whistle blows]

198
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:40,479
I see some of you new boys
looking at me and thinking to yourselves,

199
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:45,604
"Isn't this the Okeke Tony
who used to play for the Super Eagles?"

200
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:50,771
Well, I can tell you for free
that, yes, I am he.

201
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:52,896
[chuckles] Mmm-hmm.

202
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:55,312
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,396
Mmm-mmm.

204
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:02,187
You can't play without boots,
shin pads, and hoses.

205
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:05,479
Go to the lost and found
and get something.

206
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:11,021
[upbeat music playing]

207
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,812
[players muttering and laughing]

208
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,604
Let's play ball!

209
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:18,687
[whistle blows]

210
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,854
[coach] If you do not jump for the ball,
you cannot get the header!

211
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:28,271
[whistle blows]

212
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,729
-All right, let's play ball!
-[whistle blows]

213
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:35,646
[upbeat music continues]

214
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:39,646
Pass!

215
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:41,812
Pass the ball!

216
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:44,021
Pass! Pass!

217
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:47,812
Shoot! Shoot!

218
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:50,771
Yes!

219
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:55,437
New boy! Welcome to the team, new boy!

220
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,437
Reggie, give him a warm welcome.

221
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,937
-Baller.
-Hey.

222
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:01,271
-Nice one, bro.
-Thanks, man.

223
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:03,729
Hey, we're about to head over
to the cheerleading tryouts.

224
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:04,937
-Wanna come?
-Sure.

225
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:06,146
-All right.
-All right.

226
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,979
[upbeat music continues]

227
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:23,896
You're in.

228
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,354
Next.

229
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:27,271
[Nen] Zina.

230
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:30,146
[Ishaya] Bro, that's my friend.

231
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,312
Go, Zina! Go, Zina!

232
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,562
[Nen] Hey, here's your uniform.

233
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:36,229
Let me see that.

234
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:46,771
Nen, you know this is a cheer squad,
not a choir, right?

235
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:49,187
My mum wants us to look decent.

236
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:52,521
[huffs] Start, please.

237
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:54,604
[hip-hop music playing]

238
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:57,729
[Ishaya] Go, Zina.

239
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,521
[whispers] That's my friend.

240
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:13,646
-[mouths] Oh, yeah!
-[hip-hop music continues]

241
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:27,646
-[music stops suddenly]
-[all groaning]

242
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:29,437
[Nen] This is not a music video audition.

243
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,271
But she was amazing!

244
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:34,854
She's clearly not cheer squad material.
She'll be a distraction.

245
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:37,937
Which we'll need when
we wear these nun's uniforms.

246
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,312
[Ishaya] Zina! Zina!

247
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:44,146
-Zina! Zina! Zina!
-[all cheering and whooping]

248
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:45,312
Okay, fine!

249
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,104
She's in.

250
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:48,312
-Yes!
-[Zina] Yes!

251
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:54,187
Hey, I'm having a party
at mine this weekend.

252
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,437
Bring your friend.

253
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,604
[Nen] Carmen, you're up next.

254
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:01,771
What?

255
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,437
-You're next.
-I was cheer squad captain last year.

256
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:07,062
Well, I'm cheer squad captain now.

257
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:08,812
Okay?

258
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,271
[Zina] Guess who got
invited to Reggie's party?

259
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:20,021
Please make videos so I get
to live vicariously through you guys.

260
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,146
-[both] Which one is vicariously?
-[both laughing]

261
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:23,937
-[Zina] What am I going to wear?
-Hey.

262
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:27,479
[in Pidgin] See, dude, I don't have
any time for your problems right now.

263
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:28,562
Please.

264
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,062
-[in English] You want me to tell them--
-Tell them what?

265
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:37,771
See, guys, just go ahead,
I'll catch up with you later, okay?

266
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,104
[in Pidgin] Yes?

267
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,979
[in English] I want to follow you
to Reggie's party.

268
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,354
"I want to follow you to Reggie's party."

269
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:52,021
[in Pidgin] Am I your dad?
Go away, please.

270
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,854
[upbeat music playing]

271
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:04,021
[Michael] How will you
sell it at the party?

272
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:08,271
I don't know. I'll give it to Reggie
to sell to his friends.

273
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,521
[banging on door]

274
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,729
[banging continues]

275
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,479
[Michael] Rahila.

276
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:35,521
-You decided to steal my dream from me?
-[Michael] It wasn't like that.

277
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:38,229
He's only there
so he can save you from Oga Rambo.

278
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:41,271
[in English] Whose fault was it
that I got kidnapped in the first place?

279
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:45,771
You're always so selfish.
How could you do this to me?

280
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:49,354
[melancholy music playing]

281
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:56,979
[door opens and closes]

282
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:12,104
[Mrs. Willoughby] Carmen? Nnenna's here!

283
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:17,062
I'm only allowing her to go to this party
because of you.

284
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:19,771
I trust your judgement to keep her safe.

285
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:28,312
I hope you're not here
to ask me to repeat tryouts.

286
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:31,854
And I hope you realize
that I am cheer captain, not you.

287
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:32,854
I was only helping.

288
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:35,104
If making me look weak as fuck
is you helping,

289
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,812
just keep that shit to yourself.

290
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:39,521
Well, now I know what I have to do
to get you to come over,

291
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:42,104
and it's not
getting into a life-threatening accident.

292
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:44,312
You weren't there when I needed you.

293
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,104
I didn't mean
not to come over and see you.

294
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:51,104
It's just

295
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:54,062
school, and church, and…

296
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,521
There's no excuse.

297
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:01,979
I've been a total bitch.

298
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:05,104
I should have come over and see you.

299
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:07,687
[sighs] I'm so sorry.

300
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,979
I didn't mean to disrespect you
as cheer captain.

301
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:16,979
[laughing] Come here.

302
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:19,354
I missed you.

303
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:22,437
Thank God you're here,
because I have nothing to wear.

304
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,979
Don't tell me you're going to
the pool party dressed like your mother.

305
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,062
[Carmen] Easy for you to say.

306
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,979
Your leg doesn't look like this.

307
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:35,604
I can't get plastic surgery
until the plates are out.

308
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:39,521
You know what? Fuck the scar.

309
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:41,146
Wear a bikini.

310
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:45,354
No one will notice when
they're looking at, you know, all of this.

311
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:47,312
-You know you have it.
-Nen, stop. No.

312
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,229
Come on, let's get you something to wear.

313
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:50,687
Stop being…

314
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:54,937
[dance music playing]

315
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,729
[blows into mic] All right, people.

316
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:15,812
I'd like us to give a big welcome back to…

317
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:18,729
-Carmen!
-[all whooping]

318
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:22,312
[all cheering]

319
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:25,104
[upbeat music continues]

320
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:32,771
Babe.

321
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:35,187
How was the lawyer's?

322
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:37,187
It was great.

323
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,979
He didn't think I was his?

324
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:43,604
[angrily] Did my father
tell you he didn't think I was his son?

325
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:47,062
[objects clatter]

326
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:51,979
Atlas, thank God you're here.

327
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,062
She won't take off her scarf,
or swim, or dance.

328
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,521
Maybe you can loosen her up.
I need to have some fun.

329
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:58,729
Bye.

330
00:21:58,812 --> 00:22:00,729
-Yo, Ishaya.
-Hey.

331
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:02,354
-How's it?
-It's popping, man.

332
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:05,521
-Aren't you gonna introduce us?
-I think we know each other's names.

333
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:06,854
I mean, what I don't know

334
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:09,521
is how long it's gonna take you
to have those shorts off.

335
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:11,396
Okay! Ha!

336
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,229
[guest] Cheers!

337
00:22:17,354 --> 00:22:18,354
Babe…

338
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:20,812
I think this party's a bad idea.

339
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,396
-I'm not comfortable.
-[sighs]

340
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:25,271
-My scar--
-Again with this, your scar talk!

341
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:26,187
Excuse me?

342
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:28,396
Carmen, I don't have
time for this shit today, okay?

343
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:38,479
[Reggie] What do you mean, "sold out"?

344
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:40,521
I promised people molly.

345
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:43,562
[in Pidgin] What if you
get caught by the police? It's a crime.

346
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,896
Please think of a better way.

347
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:49,104
[in English] Better way?

348
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:51,396
[in Pidgin] What better way?

349
00:22:53,229 --> 00:22:55,229
[upbeat music playing]

350
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:00,062
[in English] Ugh, fuck off.

351
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:02,104
Dude, dude, uh…

352
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,562
See this? This is top-grade shit.

353
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:07,687
Ten K per pill.

354
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:09,312
Let me see.

355
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,521
Bro, how do I know
you didn't cook this in a kitchen?

356
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:13,687
Are you buying or not?

357
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:16,812
All right.

358
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,562
Pop one.

359
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,104
[in Yoruba] Pop, why?

360
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:22,271
[in English] If it's as good as you say,
I'll buy.

361
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:24,312
-This…
-Hey, it's cool.

362
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:27,396
[Ishaya] Wait.
Whoa, whoa. Chill, chill. Um…

363
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:29,771
I'll pop it.

364
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:37,146
See you in an hour.

365
00:23:52,812 --> 00:23:55,562
[dark hip-hop music playing]

366
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:29,104
Mmm! Okay!

367
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:31,479
-Is it good?
-To be honest, this is good.

368
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:33,229
Magic hands, what can I say?

369
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:34,604
Is that what they do?

370
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:37,562
You have no idea
what these hands do, babe.

371
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,354
[Zina laughing] What, like…

372
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,812
beat up people for me?

373
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:44,021
If you need me to.

374
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:46,104
Oh, my days, you're so cheesy.

375
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:53,104
Ah!

376
00:25:04,854 --> 00:25:06,437
I'll take some of that, bro.

377
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:08,187
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

378
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:09,687
[chuckles] Okay.

379
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,354
Yeah.

380
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:14,979
-I'll sort you out later?
-Water.

381
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:16,521
Kitchen.

382
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:19,771
Down the hallway, to the right.

383
00:25:19,854 --> 00:25:21,854
[phone ringing]

384
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:27,854
Ijoba.

385
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,771
[Ijoba] <i>It's the end of the week.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

386
00:25:30,854 --> 00:25:33,271
[in Pidgin] I'm at a party.
Do you want to come around?

387
00:25:33,354 --> 00:25:35,062
I will send the address to you.

388
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:46,479
[grunts]

389
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:52,021
Hey.

390
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:53,646
Mmm!

391
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:55,604
[in English] Why?

392
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,604
You asked to take the picture
of the most beautiful girl in school.

393
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:00,396
Hmm?

394
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:01,729
Okay.

395
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,437
[Ishaya] Okay. Okay.

396
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,896
Hey!

397

-Oh, what's that?
-[grunts]

398
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:10,604
Why are you hiding it?

399
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:15,229
Shh. I want to show you something.

400
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,729
What are you doing?

401
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:19,979
See this?

402
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:24,271
It's from when I stole oranges
from my neighbors.

403
00:26:26,562 --> 00:26:27,521
This…

404
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,729
I broke my principal's windscreen.

405
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,687
[in Pidgin] They flogged me.

406
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,604
-[Ishaya] Oh…
-[romantic music playing]

407
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,104
[in English] Car accident.

408
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:48,021
I was driving.

409
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:55,437
[Ishaya] Scars reflect
who you are as a person.

410
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:58,437
You shouldn't hide it.

411
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,271
Here, let me show you this.

412
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,062
See this one? Come feel it.

413
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:09,187
You can't see it,

414
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:10,812
just feel it.

415

[upbeat music continues]

419
00:27:34,562 --> 00:27:35,979
I've missed this.

420
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:47,729
Frank.

421
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:50,521
[in Pidgin] Take a look at the house.

422
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:51,437
[laughs]

423
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,646
[in English] Living vicariously, you said?

424
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:00,479
Oh!

425
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,437
-[Atlas] What the…
-Shit!

426
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:04,187
Shit, shit, shit!

427

Enjoy.

428
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,937
-Why didn't you lock the door?
-I thought you did.

429
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:16,437
-[Atlas] Was he recording?
-I don't know!

430
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,479
Go after him, what are you doing?

431
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:20,687
[upbeat music continues]

432
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:35,771
[upbeat music continues]

433
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,604
[Mrs. Willoughby] Where are we
going this year?

434
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,312
-[woman] France.

-[Carmen] Mmm!
-Darling!

437
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:01,271
[Carmen] Mama!

438
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:03,437
Mama, hug.

439
00:29:03,937 --> 00:29:05,479

-Stop.

440
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:08,104
-[whining] Mama, give me a hug!
-Stop. Stop it.

441

[Carmen] Auntie!

442
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:13,771
-Auntie, I missed you!
-[Atlas] I can explain, Auntie.

443
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:16,062
Uh, when I found… Carmen.

444
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:18,396
[Nen] She disappeared.

445
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:21,021
And by the time we found her,
she was drunk.

446
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:23,021
Leave me.

447
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,937
You will not fail to embarrass me.

448
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:27,146
I guess I should be grateful
you didn't drive.

449
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:29,604
[slurring] Mum,
enough with this accident talk!

450
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,687
It wasn't even my fault. I wasn't the one…

-I'm really sorry, Auntie.
-[yelps]

I love you, Mama.

454

[Atlas mutters]

456
00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:42,729
Sorry.

457
00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:49,771
[woman snickers] That's more drunk
than I've ever been in my life.

is to never get high on my supply.

-Brother Government.
-Where are my pills?

467
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:24,271
[in Yoruba] I'm dead!

00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:26,937
-[in English] It's with Reggie…
-Where's my money?

469
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:29,229
[Ishaya] That's what I'm saying,
just let me call…

470
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:30,396
[Oga Rambo in Yoruba] Hey!

471
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:33,354
My Angel will eat your head first.

472

Please think of a better way!

[in English] Please, please!

477
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:45,729
[in Yoruba] I'm not Government.
I don't forgive.
