00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:20,771
[in English] It's fine, Lala. Let's go.

175
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:24,437
Let's go.

176
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,354
You look absolutely ravishing.

177
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,646
Your smile lights up the entire room.

178
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,729
-[scoffs] Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

179
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,396
[Rahila] Dreaming is destructive.

180
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,354
My dreams are unrealistic.

181
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,229
[Ishaya] Lala, that doesn't
even make sense.

182
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:51,979
No, look at Daddy.

183
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:55,812
[in Pidgin] Dad wanting to be
a famous artist lost us our brother.

184
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,896
Now he's in pain every time.

185
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:01,437
[in English] Maybe Daddy
will actually stop being in pain

186
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:04,229
if he starts doing what he loves,
just painting.

187
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:07,896
That's why, me, I'm chasing my dream.

188
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:16,104
Lala, just because
you can't get into Wilmer

189
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:19,979
doesn't mean you can't be the neuro…

190
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:22,146
whatever doctor you decide you want to be.

191
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,062
Wilmer is not the only school in Lagos.

192
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:26,104
It's neurosurgeon.

193
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,562
You shut up your dirty mouth.

194
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,479

[in Yoruba] What did he do?

201
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:03,937
[in English] He broke my number-one rule.

202
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,396
Got high on my supply.

203
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,937
[in Yoruba] That's a serious offense.

212

213
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:47,104
[in English] Ijoba, Rush is our business.

214
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:48,687
[in Yoruba] Why are you selling pills?

215
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:50,146
[in English] We need to diversify.

216
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:54,854
This will attract rich young people.

217
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:57,187

know this business is not new.

218

to develop new markets.

219

[in Yoruba] You're losing your mind,
Government.

220
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:06,104

Lala.

236
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,021
It's still the same pain,

237
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:18,729
but it was worse this time around,
so we had to rush him to the hospital.

238

[Ishaya in Yoruba] Why didn't you call me?

239

240

[Ishaya] How much
do we owe the hospital now?

241

[Patricia in English] Ishaya…

244
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,146
The medicine they said
we should buy for your father,

245
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:50,271
that we couldn't afford…

246
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:51,771
I've bought them.

247
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:55,271
And the remaining money,
we'll use it for our house rent.

248
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:59,146
Mummy, please give me back my money.

249
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:02,229
Mummy, this is the money
for the apprenticeship in London.

back the rest of my money. Please.

-London.

257
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,062

you are using to treat him?

Just three months!

How would you go about it?

273
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,604
I will go to London.

And you don't even have enough
for the ticket yet.

279

to count ten fucking bundles?

347
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,771
Sorry. Sorry, sir. I'm done.

[music stops]

351
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:16,771
[in Yoruba] You're obsessed with music.
All day long, it's music! Why?

352
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:21,562
[in English] Here.

353
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:24,521
What's this?

354
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:26,479
Wilmer entrance exam answers.

355
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:29,521
But, Daddy, I can pass it on my own.

356
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:31,479
One thing I've always wanted,

357
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:35,979
to be the managing director
of Five Star Realty,

358
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:40,646
selling mansions to billionaires.

359
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,187
And you know where those billionaires are?
Wilmer Academy.

360
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:48,479
I need you to memorize those answers,

361
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:50,187
get in,

362
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,312
help me get rich.

363
00:24:52,396 --> 00:24:55,396
With a scholarship,
there's no school fees.

364
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:59,187
And $10,000 award.

365
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:01,646
So, cram those answers.

366
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:03,312
Capisce?

367
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:04,979
Capisce.

368
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:08,729
[exclaims softly]

00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:26,771
Sorry, sir.

371
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:51,312
Cleaner boy, wait!

372
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,687
I threw something away by mistake.

373
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:00,229
Open the bag.

374
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:14,687
What are you looking for now?

375
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:16,687
Shut up. Don't ask such stupid questions.

-[Ishaya] Lala.
-Hmm?

377
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:53,562
What if I told you I had the answers
to Wilmer entrance exams?

378
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:56,354
100% guaranteed,
you'd get the scholarship.

379
00:26:57,854 --> 00:26:59,771
I still don't have the money for the test.

380
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:02,021
What if I told you
I had the money for the test too?

381
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:03,979
I don't think
I want to go there by cheating.

382
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:06,562
It only means I don't deserve to be there,
so, no.

383
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:26,771
[in Pidgin] You know how much
the top student wins?

384
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:27,896
How much? A million?

385
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,396
Six million.

386
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:32,771
Look at you,
I've already registered with 150,000.

387
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:36,771
Where'd you get the money?
Why are you stealing Rahila's dream?

388
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,521
I asked her, she said
she won't cheat to achieve her dream.

389
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:42,396
[in English] Me,
I'll do anything to get my dream.

391
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,521
Here, help me learn the answers.

392

[in English] Number one, B.
Number two, C. Number three…

one of the best years

[Gemade] Without further ado,

444

I'd like to call on
the great-granddaughter of the founder

to the new academic year.

Sorry, but I don't see it.

It's an honor to welcome you all
to the new academic session.

And anyone who dates Atlas
is definitely not a good person.

00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:18,979
Atlas?

00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,521
What, like the map of the world?

Thank you.

455
00:32:29,437 --> 00:32:31,979
[Gemade] Now, before the tour,

456
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:35,854
I'd like to introduce someone special.

457
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:40,229
This year,
we started a scholarship program,

458
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:43,104
which is sponsored by Pastor Okolo.

who had a perfect score.

465
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:12,812
[Frank] I can't believe
you're the scholarship student.

466
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:14,479
I came second in the exam.

467
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:16,021
We need to talk.

468
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:19,854
Hey. You want a picture
with the scholarship student, right?

469
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:21,187
Come back, I'm busy.

470
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:23,021
-How dare you!
-[Carmen clears throat]

471
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:26,062
Can I have your attention?

472
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:29,604
[Ishaya] Let's go.

473
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:34,437
[Atlas] Put this thing
on the wall properly now.

474
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,562
-That's now how you--
-[Carmen] Atlas! Hey, babe.

475
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:37,646
[Atlas] Hey.

00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:40,479

477
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:42,146
-[Atlas] How are you?
-I'm okay.

478
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,396
-[Atlas] How's the tour going?
-Frustrating.

479
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:45,854
Guys, this is--

480
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:47,021
Frankincense!

481
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:49,646
Is that you I smell?

482
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:51,771
Atlas, we're too old for this.

483
00:33:51,854 --> 00:33:53,437
Come on, babe.

484
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:54,854
He clearly missed me.

485
00:33:55,437 --> 00:33:59,062
That's why he followed me
all the way to Wilmer, right?

486
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:00,646
My name is… I'm Frank.

487
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:03,854
Yes, but the full thing
is Frankincense, right?

488
00:34:03,937 --> 00:34:05,979
-Frankincense--
-[Ishaya] Hey, hey.

489
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:08,562
[in Pidgin] Madam Tour Guide,
can we focus on why we're here?

490
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,979
[in English] Or is your boyfriend
what we're here to see?

491
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:13,562
Let's go.

492
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:18,021
FYI, the name is Carmen.

493
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:19,979
And it's this way.

494
00:34:28,229 --> 00:34:30,396
Put this thing on the wall properly now.

495
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:34,312
And this is the brand-new art gallery.

496
00:34:46,229 --> 00:34:48,229

497
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:49,354
[Patricia] You drew this?

498
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:51,604
I want to be an artist, Mummy, like Daddy.

499
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:54,146
[Patricia] But you know
art is forbidden in this house.

500
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:58,187
Daddy! Daddy!

501
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,646
Let me guess. Artist.

502
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,187
How did you know?

503
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:08,604
You really need to learn
how not to touch without permission.

504
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:14,479
This way.

505
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:16,562
[upbeat music playing]

506
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,062
Ma, my $10,000.

507
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:35,146
Can I get it now?

508
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:39,312
As soon as we receive your transcript
from your secondary school.

509
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,187
Transcript?

510
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:43,521
School resumes next week Monday,

511
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:45,729
so please bring it to us by then.

512
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:53,354
[man] I thought you were so stupid
you couldn't memorize the answers,

513
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:54,729
but you're even more stupid,

514
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:58,396
'cause you threw it away, and now
the cleaner's son got the scholarship.

515
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:01,687
I wanted to prove
that I could do it on my own.

516
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:06,604
You are an idiot if you think anyone can
achieve anything honestly in this world!

[in Yoruba] Get out of my sight!

518
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:11,812

Nonsense.

00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:13,104

00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:17,729
You are fired!

522
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:19,562
<i>Sir, please…</i>

523
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:22,687
Go and ask that thief you call a son.

[Ishaya in Pidgin]
Bro AB, I know I owe you money.

525
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,979
Please, just let me run this package.

526
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,771
[in English] Whatever it is,
my answer is no.

527
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:37,146
[in Pidgin] My guy, please,
this is very important.

528
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,771
-I said no!
-[Michael] Guy, calm down!

529
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:45,812
Please, it's just this document
I need help with.

530
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:48,521
Replace her name with mine.

531
00:36:57,021 --> 00:36:59,479
-[AB] It'll cost 50K.
-Jesus!

532
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:00,937
50K is too much for this!

533
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:02,021
[AB mutters]

534
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,604
[AB in English] Wait.

535
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:08,146
[Ishaya in Pidgin] <i>I don't have 50K.</i>

[somber music playing]

537
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:33,896
[in English] Take.

538
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:37,937
[in Pidgin] I'm pleading with you,

539
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:40,354
as soon as you get the scholarship money,

540
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,896
return it,
because it's my office contribution.

541
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,146
-I don't want problems.
-Mike…

542
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,687
I beg you in the name of God.

543
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:47,729
[in English] Thank you.

544
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,771
Thank you.

[upbeat music playing]

546
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:06,896
[Atlas] Mum, this is the tenth time
I'm calling you. Call me back.

547
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:10,521
I can't apply for the London Art Institute
grant if my school fees aren't paid.

548
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:13,271
I can't keep living at Reggie's house.

549
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:14,937
It's like I'm homeless.

550
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:16,229
Call me back.

551
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:20,812
No! Ugh!

552
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:21,979
[man in Yoruba] Baby.

553
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:26,854
Can you imagine
that useless man named Allen…

554
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,146
-Uh-huh?
-[in English] You know, his school

555
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:32,354
is now participating
in the London Art Institute grant?

556
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:35,229
-I thought that was exclusive to us.
-Apparently not.

557
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:39,187
[Atlas] Good morning.

558
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:43,687
-[Mrs. Willoughby] Oh, Atlas!
-I see you have a new Essien on your wall.

559
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:47,396
One day very soon, we'll have
an Atlas original when you win the grant.

560
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,812
[both chuckling]

561
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:03,062
-[maid] Miss Carmen.
-What?

562
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:05,687
Your friend has come
to carry you to school, so Mummy said--

563
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:06,979
Tell Mummy to come now!

564
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,146
-You mean I should tell her--
-Tell her to come now!

565
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:14,812
[Mrs. Willoughby] Uh, excuse me.

566
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:16,271
[maid whispers]

567
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,229
Mmm, okay, okay, uh…

568
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,146
-I'll be right back.
-[Mr. Willoughby] Oh, dear.

569
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:26,062
So, Atlas, how's your mother?

570
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,146
Uh, she's good.

571
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:29,271
Good.

572
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,146
[Mrs. Willoughby] What's going on here?

573
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:38,937
Give it to me!

574
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:42,229
You don't need any more painkillers.
Only people in pain need it.

575
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:45,896
Even Dr. Olaoye says you don't need pills.

576
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:48,937
-It's been a year--
-Neither you nor her shattered your leg!

577
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:50,062
[Mrs. Willoughby] Enough!

578
00:39:51,146 --> 00:39:54,146
People are watching,
waiting for you to have a breakdown.

579
00:39:54,646 --> 00:39:57,021
You're a Wilmer Willoughby, my daughter.

580
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:02,021
So chin up and smile!

581
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:07,354
It feels like
I have no control over my life.

582
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:09,604
She even took my painkillers.
I don't get it.

583
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:12,854
Is it her pain? Ugh.
I can't wait to leave this house.

584
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:15,021
Babe, take it easy.

585
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,146
In two years,

586
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:20,396
you and I'll be eating caviar
and drinking champagne along the Thames.

587
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:21,854
[Carmen] Hmm.

588
00:40:24,146 --> 00:40:25,104
Okay.

589
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:28,021
Thank you.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby.

604
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,062
I have to get someone
to call your school's records office

605
00:41:41,146 --> 00:41:42,396
to verify this.

606
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:43,854
Verify?

607
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:46,646
The thing is,

608
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,396
the school, their phone lines are down.

609
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:51,687
So they gave me, um, a phone number

610
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:54,229
that you can call
in case you need to verify.

611
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:57,812
Sorry. Just write it down for you here.

Car, you ready for your
welcome back party this weekend?

00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,104
Why? Oh, my bad! It was a surprise?

620

[laughs] Surprise.

621
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:54,146
[Atlas] Babe,
I can cancel if it's too much.

622

[sighs] No. It's probably what I need.

623

[Nen] Yes, Mummy.

624
00:42:59,562 --> 00:43:02,896
May God be with you too
as we accomplish His new mission.

625
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:04,646
Amen.

626
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:07,646
Crazy.

627
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:10,729
Now that we are all gathered together,

628
00:43:10,812 --> 00:43:13,146
I have a very special
"Welcome back to Wilmer"

629

-To the shrine?

Bro, this shit smells different.

Yeah, man, I got the Holy Grail of kush
all for Car's first day.

Ma?

641
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,604
My secretary has your uniforms
and schedule.

642
00:44:12,146 --> 00:44:13,521
The transcript?

643
00:44:13,604 --> 00:44:14,479

Um, so, my prize money, where is it?

646
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:24,646
-You mean the grant.
-Yes.

647
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:27,562
You can collect it at the end of the day
from the bursar.

648
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:34,687
Oh, thank you.

649
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,146
Car, baby, no.

650
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:37,896
You should know better.

651
00:44:38,562 --> 00:44:42,979
Good thing secondhand smoking is a thing,
so just breathe in, Car, baby.

652
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:46,812
-[smacks lips]
-[Nen] So what's your problem?

653
00:44:46,896 --> 00:44:50,146
If this is about last week,
I told you, I had a church thing.

654
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,771
Nen, this is about the last few months,

655
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:55,104
and a quick puff-puff-pass
is not going to fix it.

656
00:44:55,187 --> 00:44:57,187
Can you guys please not fuck up my high?

657
00:44:57,271 --> 00:44:58,521
Exactly.

658
00:44:58,604 --> 00:44:59,896
Let's just go to class.

659
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:01,896
Is that shit because
I'm a year behind now?

660
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:05,104
Good God, Carmen. Reggie, please,
light one up for this girl.

661
00:45:05,187 --> 00:45:06,604
She needs to chill.

662
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,104
Babe, you think
maybe it's because of the pills?

663
00:45:11,062 --> 00:45:12,104
What pills?

664
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:14,354
[Carmen scoffs]

665

666
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:37,229
[Reggie] Fuck.

667
00:45:37,312 --> 00:45:38,146
[Atlas] Leave.

668
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:43,937
-Are you deaf? I said get the--
-[Nen] Hey, let's go.

669
00:45:49,812 --> 00:45:51,896
Hey, don't be a snitch.

670
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:02,771
Just for today.

671
00:46:03,729 --> 00:46:05,687
[teacher] Simile, metaphor…

672
00:46:06,312 --> 00:46:07,479
Can I help you?

673
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:10,146
Um…

674
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:12,062
I'm Ishaya Bello.

675
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:13,312
I'm new.

676
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:17,396
Everyone is,
and no one else is late, Mr. Scholarship.

677
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:19,729
Can you get somewhere to sit?

678
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:28,229
As I was saying,

679
00:46:28,312 --> 00:46:31,062
alliteration, irony.

680
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:33,271
Who can tell me the ninth one?

681
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:35,896
I have listed eight out of nine…

Do you like Carmen?

686
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,437
You were drawing her.

687
00:47:22,521 --> 00:47:24,104
[laughs] Um…

688
00:47:27,687 --> 00:47:28,521
Here.

-For helping me tie my tie.
-[woman exclaims] Oh, my God.

690
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:35,521
You drew this in 40 minutes?

691

Well, 20, actually.

00:47:38,562 --> 00:47:39,604

-I wasn't talking to you.
-Me?

696
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:48,729
I'm Frank. Frank Abok.

697
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:50,521
[Zina] Hi, it's nice to meet you guys.

698
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:53,687
Today we're going to discuss
the plans for the semester,

699
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,437
so no need for your pencils.

700
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:12,604
This year we're also doing
something very different

701
00:48:12,687 --> 00:48:14,812
for the London Art Institute grant.

702
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:18,104
Now, everyone can participate,
but only three students,

703
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,521
one from your year and
two from the second year,

704
00:48:20,604 --> 00:48:24,729
will be submitting
directly to the London Art Institute.

705
00:48:24,812 --> 00:48:28,312
Now, to select the students,
I will be giving you all an assignment.

706
00:48:28,396 --> 00:48:30,271
Deadline is next Thursday.

707
00:48:41,646 --> 00:48:42,646
You're very talented.

708
00:48:44,896 --> 00:48:48,104
I look forward to seeing
your submission for the shortlist.

709
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:51,312
I don't think I'll be submitting anything.

710
00:48:54,479 --> 00:48:58,104
After removing the cost
of books and uniform,

711
00:48:58,187 --> 00:49:01,146
your balance is now 5,000 naira.

712
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:04,021
Sir?

713
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:09,312
Five thousand what?

714
00:49:13,562 --> 00:49:15,562
[somber music playing]

715
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:22,687
[phone vibrating]

716
00:49:28,437 --> 00:49:30,271
[in Pidgin] Michael,
I was given 5,000 naira.

717
00:49:31,479 --> 00:49:32,771
[crying]

718
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:35,896
I was given 5,000 naira, what do I do?

719
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:39,021
What do I do?

720
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:41,979
[somber music continues]

721
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:57,187
[Ishaya in English] Jesus.

722
00:50:01,104 --> 00:50:02,437
[Ijoba in Yoruba] Don't you know

723
00:50:03,146 --> 00:50:04,854
I'm from the streets?

724
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:08,271
[in English] Rambo's family…

725
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:15,812
took me in and raised me.

726
00:50:17,312 --> 00:50:18,729
When his mother died,

727
00:50:19,854 --> 00:50:21,437
we were left on our own,

728
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,229
hustling on the streets.

729
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:32,729
You can ask your father,
who knew us before we started our business

730
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,646
that earned us our respect.

731
00:50:39,396 --> 00:50:40,396
Then you have the…

732
00:50:42,479 --> 00:50:43,437
temerity…

733
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:49,021
to steal 150,000 naira from us.

734
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:49,937
[Patricia] Huh?

735
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:53,479
[in Yoruba] You think we are so stupid
that we don't have cameras

736
00:50:53,562 --> 00:50:55,062
in the money room?

737
00:50:55,646 --> 00:50:59,354
[in English] Brother Government,
Brother Rambo, please, I'll pay you--

738
00:50:59,437 --> 00:51:00,896
[Patricia yelps]

739
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:08,396
[in Pidgin] Please, I'll pay you back,
I just need a little time.

740
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:09,646
Please, a little time--

741
00:51:09,729 --> 00:51:11,896
[Ijoba in Yoruba] Government,
Angel is hungry.

742
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:13,646
Let's feed him to her.

743
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:15,604
-[both exclaim]
-[man] Uh, Kasali--

744
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:17,104
[Oga Rambo] Don't call me that!

745
00:51:18,187 --> 00:51:19,521
That's not my name.

746
00:51:20,396 --> 00:51:21,771
[in English] I'm sorry, Oga Rambo.

747
00:51:21,854 --> 00:51:23,396
Please. I beg you.

748
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:26,896
[Ishaya sobs in Pidgin] I'll pay you back,
I just need just a little time.

749
00:51:26,979 --> 00:51:28,604
[in English] Please. Please.

750
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:30,729
Please. Please, sir. Please.

751
00:51:30,812 --> 00:51:32,021
You have one week.

752
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:37,229
Or your sister will clear your debt
in our private rooms.

753
00:51:37,937 --> 00:51:41,021
No. No, take me, I'll follow you.

754
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:42,229
Leave my daughter.

755
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:45,729
[in Yoruba] Woman, no man
will pay anything to look at you.

756
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:51,521
[Ishaya in Pidgin] Please, please,
I'll pay the money. I just need time.

757
00:51:51,604 --> 00:51:54,187
[Rahila sobs in English] We'll pay your
money back, sir, please.

758
00:51:54,271 --> 00:51:56,771
Mummy, don't let them take me! Leave me!

759
00:51:56,854 --> 00:51:59,437
-[shrieks] Leave me! Leave me!
-My daughter! My daughter!

760
00:51:59,521 --> 00:52:02,187
-Please, sir! No, don't take her, please!
-[Rahila screams] No!

761
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:05,604
[Ishaya] Mummy, Mummy, Mummy!
Don't follow them!

762
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:07,521
-[Rahila] Mummy!
-[Ishaya] Don't follow them.

763
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:09,604
[Oga Rambo in Yoruba] Crazy people,
leave my sight.

764
00:52:09,687 --> 00:52:12,271
[in English] I'll pay you back your money.
Mr. Government, please!

765
00:52:13,604 --> 00:52:16,604
[angrily] You did this… so fix it!

766
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:19,437
Go look for their money and pay them.

767
00:52:20,646 --> 00:52:23,104
[Patricia] Ishaya,
get out of this house now!

768
00:52:23,771 --> 00:52:26,062
